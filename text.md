Given the 24-hour timeframe, focusing on a single cohesive project with impactful features is key. Here’s a suggested project that combines various elements of customer insights and personalized recommendations:

Project Title: “Personalized Financial Assistant for Customer Retention and Engagement”

Project Overview:

Develop a personalized financial assistant that leverages the customer segmentation dataset to offer tailored financial insights, product recommendations, and spending advice. This assistant can help improve customer retention, engagement, and satisfaction by providing relevant information and proactive suggestions.

Key Features:

	1.	Customer Segmentation and Profiling:
	•	Use clustering (e.g., K-means) to segment customers into different groups based on attributes like account balance, transaction frequency, transaction amount, location, and demographics (age and gender).
	•	Create personalized profiles for each segment, identifying characteristics such as “high-value saver,” “frequent spender,” or “low-balance customer.”
	2.	Proactive Financial Health Notifications:
	•	Analyze recent transaction history and account balance trends to provide customers with real-time insights on their financial health.
	•	Send proactive alerts, such as:
	•	Low balance warnings
	•	Spending trend summaries (e.g., “You spent 30% more on dining last month”)
	•	Tips to avoid overdraft or boost savings based on spending patterns.
	3.	Personalized Financial Product Recommendations:
	•	Based on each customer’s profile and transaction history, recommend relevant financial products like credit cards, loans, or savings accounts.
	•	For example:
	•	A high-balance customer might be recommended investment products.
	•	A customer with frequent low balances might be suggested a low-interest credit line or overdraft protection.
	4.	Anomaly Detection for Fraud Prevention:
	•	Integrate an anomaly detection feature that flags suspicious transactions based on the customer’s typical spending behavior.
	•	If a transaction deviates significantly from normal patterns (e.g., unusually high amount, different location, or time), it can trigger a warning to the customer.
	•	Example: “Unusual transaction detected for INR 50,000 in a new location. Was this you?”
	5.	Spending Pattern Analysis and Budgeting Tips:
	•	Provide a breakdown of monthly expenses by category, leveraging transaction amounts and other patterns to classify expenses (e.g., groceries, travel, dining).
	•	Suggest a monthly budget based on average expenses and provide tips to save money in specific categories where spending is high.
	•	Example: “You spent INR 10,000 on dining last month. Consider a budget of INR 7,500 to save INR 2,500.”
	6.	Churn Prediction Alerts:
	•	Use historical transaction data to identify patterns that may indicate churn risk (e.g., declining transaction volume or sudden low balances).
	•	If a customer is flagged as at-risk for churn, send a targeted offer or engage them with special loyalty rewards to encourage continued usage.
	7.	Intelligent Reports and Insights Generation:
	•	At the end of each month, generate an automated report summarizing the customer’s financial activities, including spending trends, major transactions, and net savings.
	•	Present insights on financial goals and offer suggestions for the upcoming month.
	•	Example: “Your balance grew by INR 5,000 this month! Keep it up by maintaining a budget in your top spending category.”

Implementation Outline:

	1.	Data Processing:
	•	Clean the dataset and format fields (e.g., dates, balances).
	•	Prepare customer profiles with calculated metrics like average transaction amount, balance trends, and transaction frequency.
	2.	Modeling:
	•	Customer Segmentation: Use clustering to group customers into segments for personalized recommendations.
	•	Anomaly Detection: Implement a model (e.g., Isolation Forest or Z-score) for detecting outliers in transaction patterns.
	•	Churn Prediction: Use logistic regression or a simple decision tree to predict churn risk based on recent activity.
	3.	Backend API:
	•	Build API endpoints to serve personalized insights, alerts, and recommendations in real-time.
	•	API examples: GET /customer/<id>/insights, GET /customer/<id>/recommendations, GET /transaction/<id>/anomaly-check
	4.	Frontend Interface (Optional):
	•	If time permits, create a basic UI to display insights, alerts, and recommendations for each customer.
	•	Alternatively, present results in a report format or via a chatbot interface for easy interaction.
	5.	Testing & Evaluation:
	•	Test the model and insights on sample customer data to validate the accuracy and relevance of insights and alerts.
	•	Adjust model parameters as needed for better performance within the hackathon timeframe.

Why This Project?

This project is manageable within 24 hours and provides a wide range of features that showcase your ability to use data for personalized customer experiences. It combines customer segmentation, predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and actionable insights into one cohesive product.

Presentation Tips:

	•	Highlight the business value: how it improves customer retention, satisfaction, and engagement.
	•	Showcase sample outputs for different customer profiles to illustrate personalization.
	•	Emphasize data-driven insights with real examples, such as spending patterns and personalized recommendations.

Using the ChatGPT API, you can enhance the project by creating an interactive Personalized Financial Assistant Chatbot. This chatbot could answer customer questions, provide insights on spending habits, make financial product recommendations, and even flag unusual transactions. Here’s how you can integrate it:

Steps to Integrate ChatGPT API:

	1.	Define the Chatbot’s Functions:
	•	Set up the chatbot to answer questions related to:
	•	Account balance summaries
	•	Spending analysis and budgeting tips
	•	Personalized product recommendations (based on customer profile and transaction history)
	•	Alerts for unusual transactions or low balance warnings
	2.	Create Sample Prompts for Different Scenarios:
	•	Based on each customer’s profile, generate prompts that the ChatGPT API will use to craft responses. Here are some examples:
	•	Spending Summary: “Summarize this customer’s spending pattern for the past month and suggest areas where they could save money.”
	•	Recommendation: “Based on this customer’s profile, recommend a financial product that could help them manage their spending better.”
	•	Anomaly Alert: “Inform the customer about a recent transaction that was unusual and ask them to confirm if it was theirs.”
	•	Customize the prompts with the actual data (like spending amount, location, etc.) for each customer.
	3.	Set Up API Calls:
	•	Use your server or a backend script to make calls to the ChatGPT API, providing the prompt and any necessary data as input.
	•	Example code to send a prompt to ChatGPT API (in Python):

import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def get_chat_response(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a financial assistant chatbot."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Example usage
prompt = "Summarize the spending pattern for a customer with high dining expenses and suggest ways to save."
print(get_chat_response(prompt))


	4.	Integrate Responses into the User Interface:
	•	Display the response from ChatGPT in the user interface as a chatbot reply.
	•	Use buttons or prompts to guide the user through different actions, like requesting a spending summary, asking for recommendations, or checking for unusual transactions.
	5.	Dynamic Interaction Based on Customer Profile:
	•	For example, if a customer is flagged as a high spender, the chatbot could automatically suggest savings tips or a budgeting plan.
	•	If an anomaly is detected, the chatbot can ask, “We noticed an unusual transaction of INR 20,000 from a new location. Was this you?”

Example Interactions:

	•	Spending Insights:
	•	User: “How much did I spend last month?”
	•	Chatbot: “You spent a total of INR 50,000 last month, with 30% on dining. Consider budgeting INR 10,000 for dining to save more.”
	•	Product Recommendations:
	•	User: “Any suggestions for credit products?”
	•	Chatbot: “Based on your current spending pattern, you might benefit from a rewards credit card that offers cashback on dining and groceries.”
	•	Fraud Alert:
	•	Chatbot: “We detected a transaction of INR 10,000 from a new location. If this wasn’t you, please contact support.”

This setup adds conversational interactivity to your project, leveraging ChatGPT’s language abilities to provide engaging and personalized customer support.
